### Search

Using only HTML and CSS, create three webpages: one with a search bar that performs normal google searches, one with a search bar that performs google image searches, and one with a search bar that performs advanced google searches. The CSS of the pages resembles that of Google.

## Week 3

### Wiki

Create a website using only python (django as web framework), HTML and CSS that allows users to view Wikipedia-esque webpages with information on different topics. Users can search for different topics, create pages for new topics, edit pages for existing topics, or be taken to a page for a random topic by clicking a link.

## Week 4

### Commerce

Create a commerce website (kind of an ebay clone) using only python (django as framework and for SQL models), HTML and CSS where users can bid for and sell items. Users can also leave comments on posts, add items to their watchlist, categorize items for searching, and view posts for items.

## Week 5 - Week 6

### Mail

Create an email website using only javascript, HTML and CSS (python code already written) that allows users to view emails, send emails, archive emails, and reply to emails. The website is all done through one page manipulated by javascript.

## Week 7

### Network

Create a social media site using python (django for framework and SQL models), javascript, HTML and CSS where users can create posts and view most recent posts from other users. Users can also visit user profiles, follow other users and see their recent posts, edit their own posts, like posts, and view paginated posts.

## Week 8

### Sportsconnect

Final project of course, students must create their own website from an idea of their own. Sportsconnect is a website where users can create posts looking for other people in their area to play certain sports with depending on their level of competition, age, and other factors. Users can send messages back and forth to each other or create group messages, look at each other's profiles, respond to posts, and leave reviews for users. Project is currently in development.
